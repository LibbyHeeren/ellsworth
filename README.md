# The Ellsworth Project

The idea for this app struck my brain the moment I saw [Stacey at The Crooked Hem](https://thecrookedhem.net/about-the-crooked-hem/) post on her Instagram about creating a quilt based on Ellsworth Kelly's Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance III. I googled the series of artwork and was immediately in love with Kelly's process of creating colorful artwork using random chance and pattern constraints. I hope this app helps at least one person plan the quilt of their dreams!     

I hope to add features to this app over time. If there's something you'd like to see added, [open an issue here in GitHub](https://github.com/LibbyHeeren/ellsworth/issues/new/choose), or leave a comment on one of my blog posts about the project. It was written in R, developed in RStudio, and is hosted on [Posit Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) (which is JUST AMAZING).   

You can see my development notes for this app on [my blog](www.libbyheeren.com/blog), and you can [**see the app here**](https://libbyheeren-ellsworth.share.connect.posit.cloud/) if you like!

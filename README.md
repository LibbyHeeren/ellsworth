# The Ellsworth Project

This is a working space for now - but it will hopefully be a shiny app soon!

The plan is to build an app that lets users simulate pieces of artwork by Ellsworth Kelly, specifically the style of his Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance. I am fascinated by his exploration of randomness and color. As a stats nerd type, I couldn't resist exploring his process via R code.

For now, the files are a bit of a mess, very exploratory. The structure will change as I go, and I'll be blogging my process to preserve some of it in its gloriously messy state. Stay tuned for links to that stuff.
